# Troubleshooting Guide

Common issues and solutions for Voicebox.

## Installation Issues

### macOS: "Voicebox cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer"

**Solution:**
1. Right-click the `.dmg` file
2. Select "Open"
3. Click "Open" in the security dialog
4. Alternatively, go to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Allow Voicebox

### Windows: "Windows protected your PC"

**Solution:**
1. Click "More info"
2. Click "Run anyway"
3. Windows Defender may flag new software; this is normal for unsigned apps

### Linux: AppImage won't run

**Solution:**
```bash
chmod +x voicebox-*.AppImage
./voicebox-*.AppImage
```

## Runtime Issues

### Server won't start

**Symptoms:** App opens but shows "Server not connected"

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Python installation**
   ```bash
   python --version  # Should be 3.11+
   ```

2. **Check server binary exists**
   - Look in `tauri/src-tauri/binaries/` for your platform
   - Binary should match your system architecture

3. **Check permissions**
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   chmod +x tauri/src-tauri/binaries/voicebox-server-*
   ```

4. **Check logs**
   - macOS: Open Console.app and search for "voicebox"
   - Linux: Check `~/.local/share/voicebox/` for logs
   - Windows: Check Event Viewer

### "Model download failed"

**Symptoms:** First generation fails with download error

**Solutions:**
1. **Check internet connection**
   - Models download from HuggingFace Hub (~2-4GB)
   - First download may take several minutes

2. **Check disk space**
   - Models are cached in `~/.cache/huggingface/`
   - Ensure at least 5GB free space

3. **Manual download** (if automatic fails)
   ```bash
   pip install huggingface_hub
   huggingface-cli download Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base
   ```

### "Out of memory" errors

**Symptoms:** Generation fails with CUDA/VRAM errors

**Solutions:**
1. **Use smaller model**
   - Switch to 0.6B model instead of 1.7B
   - Settings → Model Management → Load 0.6B

2. **Close other applications**
   - Free up GPU memory
   - Close browser tabs, other ML apps

3. **Use CPU mode**
   - Slower but works without GPU
   - Backend automatically falls back to CPU

### Audio playback issues

**Symptoms:** Generated audio won't play

**Solutions:**
1. **Check audio format**
   - Audio is saved as WAV files
   - Ensure your system supports WAV playback

2. **Try downloading audio**
   - Right-click → Download
   - Play in external player

3. **Check browser permissions** (web version)
   - Allow audio autoplay in browser settings

### Slow generation

**Symptoms:** Generation takes >30 seconds

**Solutions:**
1. **Use GPU** (if available)
   - Check Settings → Server Status
   - Should show "GPU available: true"

2. **Enable caching**
   - Voice prompts are cached automatically
   - Second generation with same voice should be faster

3. **Use smaller model**
   - 0.6B model is faster than 1.7B
   - Quality difference is minimal for most voices

4. **Check system resources**
   - Close other CPU/GPU intensive apps
   - Ensure adequate RAM (8GB+ recommended)

### AMD GPU (ROCm) on Windows

**Symptoms:** Backend always reports CPU-only on an AMD GPU (e.g., RX 7900 XTX)

**Explanation:** PyTorch ROCm builds are Linux-only. On Windows, ROCm is not supported, so the
backend falls back to CPU.

**Solutions:**
1. **Use Linux or WSL2** with ROCm-capable drivers and a ROCm build of PyTorch
2. **Use CPU mode** on native Windows (slower but supported)

## API Issues

### "Connection refused" when using API

**Solutions:**
1. **Check server is running**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:17493/health
   ```

2. **Check remote mode**
   - If connecting remotely, ensure server is started with `--host 0.0.0.0`
   - Check firewall settings

3. **Check port availability**
   - Default port is 17493 (legacy port 8000)
   - Ensure no other service is using it

### CORS errors in browser

**Solutions:**
1. **Use desktop app** (recommended)
   - Desktop app doesn't have CORS restrictions

2. **Configure CORS** (for web deployment)
   - Update `backend/main.py` CORS settings
   - Add your domain to allowed origins

## Update Issues

### "Update check failed"

**Solutions:**
1. **Check internet connection**
   - Updates are fetched from GitHub releases

2. **Check GitHub access**
   - Ensure `github.com` is accessible
   - Check firewall/proxy settings

3. **Manual update**
   - Download latest release from GitHub
   - Install manually

### "Invalid signature" error

**Solutions:**
1. **Re-download installer**
   - Signature may be corrupted
   - Download fresh copy from GitHub

2. **Check release integrity**
   - Verify `.sig` file matches installer
   - Report issue if signature is invalid

## Data Issues

### Profiles disappeared

**Solutions:**
1. **Check data directory**
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/voicebox/`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%/voicebox/`
   - Linux: `~/.local/share/voicebox/`

2. **Check database**
   - Database: `data/voicebox.db`
   - Ensure file exists and is readable

3. **Restore from backup**
   - Profiles can be exported/imported
   - Check for backup files

### "Database locked" error

**Solutions:**
1. **Close other instances**
   - Ensure only one Voicebox instance is running

2. **Restart app**
   - Close and reopen Voicebox

3. **Check file permissions**
   - Ensure database file is writable
   - Check directory permissions

## Development Issues

### Build fails

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Rust installation**
   ```bash
   rustc --version
   rustup update
   ```

2. **Check Tauri dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd tauri
   bun install
   ```

3. **Clean build**
   ```bash
   cd tauri/src-tauri
   cargo clean
   cd ../..
   bun run build
   ```

### API client generation fails

**Solutions:**
1. **Start backend server**
   ```bash
   bun run dev:server
   ```

2. **Check OpenAPI endpoint**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:17493/openapi.json
   ```

3. **Regenerate client**
   ```bash
   bun run generate:api
   ```

## Still Having Issues?
